# Substitution Cipher Program

## Objective
This project implements a substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. It also includes cryptanalysis functionality that performs letter frequency analysis to help break encrypted messages without knowing the key.

## Skills Learned
- Understanding of classical cryptography and substitution ciphers  
- Implementing encryption, decryption, and key generation algorithms 
- Performing letter frequency analysis for cryptanalysis  
- Working with Java Collections Framework (HashMapâ€™s, Lists)
- Reading and processing text data from external files  

## Tools Used
- Java (for coding the encryption and decryption logic)  
- Eclipse IDE (for development and debugging)  
- File I/O Handling (to import and analyze corpus text)  

## Implementation Details
The program consists of multiple components:
1. Key Generator: Creates a randomized mapping of letters for encryption.  
2. Encryptor: Uses the key to substitute plaintext characters with ciphertext characters.  
3. Decryptor: Reverses the encryption process using the key.  
4. Letter Frequency Analyzer: Calculates letter frequency in plaintext and ciphertext to analyze encryption effectiveness.  
5. Corpus Importer: Reads input text from a file for testing encryption and cryptanalysis.  
6. Cipher Main Class: Runs the entire process, including encryption, decryption, and frequency analysis.  

## Steps
1. Generate a substitution cipher key using Key_Generator.java
2. Encrypt a message using Encryptor.java  
3. Analyze the letter frequency in both plaintext and encrypted text  
4. Attempt decryption using Decryptor.java  
5. Compare plaintext vs. ciphertext letter distributions to assess security
